# CaseStudyExp

For this school project, we had to study Clustering Aggregation explained by this paper (https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.709.6846&rep=rep1&type=pdf). The idea was to recreate the experiments made by in the paper and to compare our evaluations in a final report.
